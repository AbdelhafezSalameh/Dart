forEach:

forEach is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and applies that function to each element in a collection.

It is typically used with lists and can be used with maps (iterating over map values or entries).

forEach is more concise and is often preferred for simple iterations where you don't need to track the index or make complex modifications to the collection.

It's easy to read and write, and it can be used with collections of any size.for-in:

for-in is a traditional loop construct that iterates over the elements of an iterable collection (e.g., lists, maps, sets, strings) by creating a variable for each element.

It provides more control over the iteration process, as you can access both the element and its index (in the case of a list).

for-in can be used to modify the elements of the collection during iteration, which can be more cumbersome with forEach.
